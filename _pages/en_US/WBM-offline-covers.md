Reload cache. If you don't see the covers on the games, press the HOME button on the Wii Remote while in WiiFlow. Select `Reload Cache`, and the covers should now appear.

The covers are zoomed in, stretched or are too small for the case.

If the covers are zoomed in, stretched or not fitting right on the cases. Power down the Wii, eject the SD card or USB drive and plug it into the computer. Open File Explorer, navigate to your device and go into the `WiiFlow` folder that's on the root. Once there, look for a folder called `cache` and delete it. Safely eject the device from the computer and plug it back into the Wii and load WiiFlow again, the covers should be there now.
