# 制作 Wii 游戏的快捷方式

This guide provides instructions on how to create Wii game shortcuts for game backups that you have on external storage devices, using a piece of software called WiiGSC (Wii Game Shortcut Creator). By creating game shortcuts, you can launch a game backup directly from the Wii Menu as if you had inserted the game as a regular disc.

::: warning

Installing [Priiloader](priiloader) and [BootMii](bootmii) are advised due to brick risk in this guide, and should keep you safe along with following the guide correctly. Do NOT continue the guide unless you have installed Priiloader or BootMii!

## 需要

- 一台 Wii
- An SD or USB drive
- A Windows computer

- [WiiGSC ModMii Edition](https://github.com/modmii/WiiGSC/releases)

## 步骤

### Section I - Creating a Channel

1. Extract the WiiGSC `.zip`, find `WiiGSC.exe`, and launch it. The first launch will prompt you about common key creation and provide a disclaimer - simply click through these windows.

2. With WiiGSC open, select `Open WBFS Drive` and select the drive letter for the device containing your WBFS files. Alternatively, you may select an individual ISO/WBFS file.

::: info

如果出现 "The system files are corrupted" 错误，不要惊慌，只要您安装了 Priiloader 就没有问题。 Turn off your Wii, then [boot into Priiloader](priiloader#section-iii---entering-priiloader) using one of the available methods for your console. Enter the Homebrew Channel and launch your WAD manager to uninstall the WAD. If priiloader was not installed, proceed to [BlueBomb](bluebomb).
